# OpenAsar-Simple-Installer
Simple installer for [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev/) for Discord, always compatible unlike the .bat installers.

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

Before using, run the `install_packages.bat` file to install the dependencies.

Finally, run the `run.bat` file to start the script itself.
